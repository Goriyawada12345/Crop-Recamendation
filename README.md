# 🌱 Smart Crop Recommendation System

An intelligent machine learning system that provides crop recommendations, fertilizer suggestions, and yield predictions based on soil and environmental parameters.

## 📋 Features

- **Crop Recommendation:** Suggests the best crops based on NPK values, pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall
- **Fertilizer Prediction:** Recommends appropriate fertilizer types and quantities based on soil composition
- **Yield Estimation:** Predicts expected crop yield (kg/hectare) based on various parameters
- **Interactive UI:** User-friendly Streamlit interface with real-time predictions
- **Modular Design:** Easy to extend and update with advanced models

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # Recommended: create a project-local virtual environment named `.venv`
   python -m venv .venv
   # Activate on Linux/macOS (zsh or bash)
   source .venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows (PowerShell)
   # .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Download datasets from Kaggle and place them in `data/raw/` directory:
   - Crop Recommendation Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset
   - Fertilizer Prediction Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gdabhishek/fertilizer-prediction
   - Yield Prediction Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patelris/crop-yield-prediction-dataset

### Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run app/app.py
```

The application will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## 🧰 Development environment (recommended)

We recommend running the app and tests inside the project virtual environment so runtime dependencies (for example, joblib and scikit-learn) are available to Streamlit and the diagnostics UI.

- Create & activate (Linux/macOS / zsh):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

- Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

- Run tests (from project root):
   ```bash
   .venv/bin/pytest -q
   ```

- Run the Streamlit app from the same environment (ensures diagnostics and model loading work):
   ```bash
   .venv/bin/streamlit run app/app.py
   ```

Note: If Streamlit is launched outside the project virtualenv, the app may display "Preprocessor diagnostics unavailable" or fail to load saved preprocessors because required packages (joblib, scikit-learn) are not on the system Python path. Using the project `.venv` avoids this issue.

## 🛠️ Development
## 📊 Smart Agriculture Dashboard
The dashboard is the central hub of the AgriMind system. It provides quick access to all major features such as crop recommendation, fertilizer advisory, yield estimation, and prediction history, enabling farmers to make data-driven decisions from a single interface.

## 🌱 Crop Recommendation
This module recommends the most suitable crop based on soil nutrients (NPK), pH value, temperature, humidity, and rainfall. It uses machine learning models to analyze environmental conditions and suggest the optimal crop for maximum productivity.
After submitting soil and environmental inputs, the system displays the recommended crop instantly. This helps farmers choose crops that are best suited to their land conditions, reducing risk and improving yield potential

)

## 🧪 Fertilizer Advisor
The fertilizer advisor suggests the most appropriate fertilizer based on soil type, crop type, and nutrient deficiencies. It ensures balanced nutrient management and helps maintain soil health.
The system displays the recommended fertilizer along with the reason (e.g., nitrogen deficiency). This supports precise fertilizer usage and avoids overuse, reducing cost and environmental impact.

)

## 🌾 Yield Estimation
This module predicts expected crop yield using historical agricultural data, rainfall, season, cultivation area, and crop type. It helps farmers plan resources and estimate production in advance.
The estimated yield is shown in kilograms, providing farmers with a clear understanding of expected output. This supports better financial and logistical planning.

## 🕒 Prediction History
The history page stores previous crop, fertilizer, and yield predictions. It allows users to track past analyses, compare results, and identify trends over time.
